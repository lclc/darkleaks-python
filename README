"Darkleaks: Decentralised Cryptographic Information Black Market"
    Scheme by Peter Todd
    Code by Amir Taaki

*Trustless provably fair information marketplace

    ###############################
    # WORK IN PROGRESS            #
    ###############################

* Distribute an encrypted file to the world.
* Reveal some random section of the contents to prove
  the legitimacy of its contents using an algorithm for provably
  fair random selection to all parties.
* People bid on the remaining parts.
* Leaker redeeming funds automatically releases the decryption key
  allowing people to unlock the remaining parts of the file.

* NO CENTRAL OPERATOR.
* NO IDENTITY NEEDED.
* NO INTERACTION WITH LEAKER REQUIRED.

See EXPLANATION. Imagine once this is a simple piece of software for
anyone to use (leaker: import file, add info, prove possession,
bidder: verify, bid on chunk, unlock) of course running all over Tor
with a nice use interface.

Decentralised way to leak and get paid for any FILE or information:
proprietary software, opensource software, corporate documents, firmware
drivers, movies .etc
